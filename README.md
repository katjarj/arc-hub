# Welcome to ARK'SHARE'YX!

**The better way to gear up is together.**

We are Grace, Jaza, Katja, and Kirsten&mdash;the team behind ARK'SHARE'YX.

ARK'SHARE'YX is a web app created for youCode, a 24-hour hackathon dedicated to fostering gender inclusivity and breaking traditional norms in the tech industry. It tackles the Arc'teryx case: How can we build and maintain connections across the various outdoor communities we touch?

## Overview

ARK'SHARE'YX is designed to help those from the greater Arc'teryx community share their outdoor gear with each other. By allowing users to connect through loaning their unused equipment and borrowing items whose cost may otherwise be prohibitive, ARK'SHARE'YX promotes sustainability, accessibility, and community.

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up:** Make an account using your email to receive one free credit.
2. **Make a Request:** Request items that you need for your upcoming trips. Each request costs one in-app credit.
3. **Fulfill Others' Requests:** Lend your gear to others to gain credits, allowing you to make future requests.
