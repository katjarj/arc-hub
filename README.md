# Welcome to ARK'SHARE'YX!

**The better way to gear up is together.**

We are Grace, Jaza, Katja, and Kirsten&mdash;the team behind ARK'SHARE'YX.

ARK'SHARE'YX is a web app created for youCode, a 24-hour hackathon dedicated to fostering gender inclusivity and breaking traditional norms in the tech industry. It tackles the Arc'teryx case: How can we build and maintain connections across the various outdoor communities we touch?

## Overview

ARK'SHARE'YX is designed to help those from the greater Arc'teryx community share their outdoor gear with each other. By allowing users to connect through loaning their unused equipment and borrowing items whose cost may otherwise be prohibitive, ARK'SHARE'YX promotes sustainability, accessibility, and community.

## Features:

- **Personal Collection:** On your profile, add and maintain a collection of items you're able to lend to others.
- **Earn and Spend Credits:** You start with one credit&mdash;earn more by lending your gear to others, and redeem them to borrow!
- **Two-Way Review System:** Evaluate and assess the reputability of potential lenders and borrowers with reviews from both parties.

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up:** Make an account using your email.
2. **Explore Available Gear:** Browse and filter through all available items on the site that have been added to people's profiles.
3. **Make a Request:** Is an item you’re looking for not available? No worries, you can also make a request post on ARK’SHARE’YX.
